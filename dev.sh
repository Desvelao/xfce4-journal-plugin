# see CLAUDE.md. Every subcommand below shells out to `docker`; the actual
# compiling, testing, and file-copying all happen inside the container. The
# only host-side actions anywhere in this project are:
#   - supplying bind-mount targets to `docker run` (this script)
#   - `xfce4-panel -r` and manual GUI interaction (not part of this script;
#     Docker cannot drive the live desktop session)
#
# This project is pure C — the compiled .so only needs ordinary
# shared-library ABI compatibility (GTK3/libxfce4panel/glibc/jansson) against
# the host, which archlinux:base-devel tracks closely since the host is also
# Arch-based (Manjaro).

Usage: $0 {build|test|install|uninstall}

  build      Compile the plugin inside Docker (archlinux:base-devel).
  test       Run the offline unit tests (meson test) inside Docker.
  install    Build, then copy artifacts into ~/.local/{lib,share}/... via a
             bind mount (the container does the copying).
  uninstall  Remove the files 'install' placed from ~/.local — host-side, no
             Docker needed. Leaves your journal config and day files untouched.
